			<h3>What is this tool?</h3>
			
			<p>This tool is an algebraic calculator.</p>
			<p>It is dedicated to undergraduate student having difficulties with algrebraic expression.</p>
			<p>The tool shows the steps of a complicated algebraic expression.</p>
			<p>The tool supports braces around expressions.</p>
			<p>It manages also implicit precedence between the plus, minus, multiplication, division and power.</p>

			<h3>How to use this tool ?</h3>
			
			<p>Enter the name of a variable , for instance "x" </p>
			<p>followed by the EQUAL sign "=" </p>
			<p>then enter an algebraic expression and finish with the semi-colon ";"</p>
			<p>for instance type the following expression finished by a semi-colon ";"</p>
			<p>y = 3.1 * ( 2.1 + 5.1); </p>
			<p>you should get y = 22.32 as a result.</p>
			<p>the underlying grammar supports three trigonometric functions: cos, sin and tan.</p>
			<p>the underlying grammar supports also the Pi constant - written Pi or pi.</p>
